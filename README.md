# Getting to know each other - Lab 3 : HTML Project that I feel accurately represents me, hosted using Microsoft Azure and Node.js
# Both the HTML file and CSS file were handmade / The Node.js template is from Eric J. Pogue
# I linked to 3 Wikipedia pages for my greatest innovations sources (DeepBlue, Toshiba T1100, Xerox Alto), and I linked to a Youtube video of a guy eating chips.

# Included my section of the website within the static folder is: index.html , gtkeo.css , sauce.jpg , what.jpg, virg.jpg, mont.jpg, FATHER.jpg, LICENSE, and README.md.
# Extract the zip file into an empty folder and run the HTML file on Chrome, or run it from the website here: https://getting-to-know-each-other-jy.azurewebsites.net/

# Node.js and Express Hosted on Microsoft Azure Template
This repository serves as a template that can be used to create a Node.js and Express based website that can easily
be hosted on Microsoft Azure.
