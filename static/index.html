                <p>I live in Plainfield and I 
                graduated from Plainfield South High School in 2020 around the time
                when the Covid-19 pandemic began. I currently live with my Mom, Dad 
                and older brother. I have an older sister that went to Lewis before, 
                but she resides in Virgina.</p> <p>I am majoring in Computer Science 
                and I want to work in cyber security. I think its important for everyone 
                to keep themselves safe when using the internet. Almost every other day 
                there is a new online threat that tries to get their hands on
                personal data, the data of businesses and companies, and the data from various
                infrastructual organizations that help our world run. The more we can 
                teach people how to recognize these threats and how to deal with them 
                if they do become compromised, the less likely these attacks will be 
                effective in the future.</p>

                <h2>What I hope to learn in this course</h2>
                <p>When I was in my sophmore year in Highschool, I took a programming class
                    which pretty much showed me the basics of Python. At that time, I didn't 
                    really think I would be able to perform well going into even more 
                    advance programming classes, let alone take an interest into programming 
                    itself, because I was struggling to meet with project deadlines. Currently, 
                    I feel like I've grown from that person I was in highschool. I 
                    want to expand my knowledge within this field because I have put 
                    it off for far too long. I hope that this class will be the first 
                    step towards where I want to be in the future, most of the stuff I 
                    learned from that highschool class I had forgotten, and I'm hoping to 
                    re-learn everything and gain more from this course.

            <div class="hobby">
            <h2>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h2>
            <p>Some of my favorite things to do when I'm not working or doing school work 
                is playing video games or watching videos on YouTube. Some of the games 
                that I'm playing right now are Red Dead Redemption 2, Cult of the Lamb, 
                and Rocket League. I haven't had the time to play games since this semester 
                started. For YouTube, I either use it for background noise, time wasting, 
                or to help me out with homework. I've been watching a lot more of criminal
                psychology / police interrogation channels, I highly recommend checking out JCS.

            <div class="fact">
            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <p>I've never been much of an outside person, but I wont turn down the opportunity
                to travel to other states or even outside the country. I've been to 
                atleast 15 states across the US, Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, and Spain. 
                I especially enjoyed my time in Spain, it has a completely different vibe than 
                in the states, and if I have the chance to go back, i'd take it 
                in a heartbeat.</p>
            <p>
                Another fun fact about me is that I refuse to eat or drink 
                anything that somebody else has already drank or bitten into.
                I'm told that I've been like this since I was a child,
                but its been a pet peeve of mine where I find it actually repulsive to even
                think about taking in something that someone had already put their saliva on.

            <h2>Greatest Innovations</h2>
            <p style="color:darkred">Here are some innovations in computer history 
                that I think are the most impressive.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>DeepBlue: A chess computer created around the 1980's by 
                    Feng-hsiung Hsu, who was a student from Carnegie Mellon University.
                    With the help from other students, they were able to create a rudimentary
                    computer from scrap boards which was able to analyze 50,000 moves/second
                    from the get-go, albeit with handfuls of bugs and a lack of training. 
                    But after taking on multiple competitions and several upgrades, it
                    wound up outperforming every artificial and human competitor, 
                    most notably, the chess grandmaster at the time, Garry Kasparov in 1997.

                        More Here</a></li>
                <li>Toshiba T1100: A computer widely recognised as the first laptop. 
                    It was produced in 1985, ran entirely off of floppy disks,
                    utilized a 4.77 MHz Intel CPU with 256-512KB of ram, and had an LCD screen. 
                    It was priced at around $1,899.

                </li> 
                <li>Alto Personal Computer: A computer created by Xerox PARC around the 
                    1970's with a rudementory graphical user interface, which likely 
                    influenced the future development of every modern computers graphical 
                    interface.
